# Arduino-Tripwire
A laser tripwire for the arduino.<br>
Built with a laser module, light dependant resistor (LDR) and a piezo speaker.<br>
<br>
The laser module is built on a separate simple switch on/off circuit, thus allowing the laser to be positioned independantly.
<br>
Note: a 8 digit 7 segment display was used for debugging values.<br>
